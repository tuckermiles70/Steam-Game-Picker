# Steam-Game-Picker

When complete, I plan for users of this application to input their steam usernames, then be given options for games which they could play together. The application will compare the game libraries of the users, and build a list of common items among all users. From this list, a random game will be chosen.

Not super useful, but mainly a fun little application for me to get an introduction to bootstrap.
